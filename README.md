# Planar

A flat file CMS.

## What is this?

This is a database-less (I think that's a word) content management system. I wanted a way to create simple websites with dynamic content, without having to install a huge wordpress instance or some other content management system. This project is perfect for small sites without too much content, but enough to make it worthwhile having objects dynamic rather than hardcoded.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
Run the dev server with `node index.js`, or if you have nodemon, `nodemon index.js`
